# Lets-Love-C
C Programming is one of the GIST's mandatory courses. 
While I was helping my friends who are taking the course, 
I was lucky enough to learn things that I did not know when I was taking the course back then. 

Thus for the sake of my improvement in C, I have decided to collect all my codes in this repository.
